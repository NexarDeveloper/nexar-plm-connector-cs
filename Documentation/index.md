# Nexar Generic PLM Connector

Nexar Generic PLM Connector framework is a reference implementation of a gRPC server 
that can be plugged into the Altium ecosystem and provide an integration with 
the unsupported PLM system. 

Generic Connector is distributed as a [C#](https://github.com/NexarDeveloper/nexar-plm-connector-cs) 
or [Java](https://github.com/NexarDeveloper/nexar-plm-connector-java) service application, 
associated documentation, and example configuration files. Generic Connector framework comes 
with two working examples of integration with Arena PLM and a simple file system storage - 
something that can be deployed and connected to the Altium ecosystem - a great starting point 
for a custom implementation.

Please refer to [PLM Integration with an Altium 365 Workspace](https://www.altium.com/documentation/altium-365/plm-integration)
for detailed information on [Altium 365](https://www.altium.com/altium-365) integration options with PLM systems.
