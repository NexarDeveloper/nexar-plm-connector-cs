# gRPC Interface Description

The **Altium 365 Generic PLM Connector** expects the service to implement the gRPC endpoint defined
in the **CustomPLM.proto** document. The following is a list of service methods with a brief description:

| Endpoint             | Parameters                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|:---------------------|:---------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TestAccess           | Auth                       | Used to verify that the credentials passed via the *Auth* parameter allow accessing the PLM service. <br/>Implementation of this method shall verify that the provided credentials allow the user to read/introduce changes to the connected PLM Service. This check, by any means, does not act as authorization/authentication of the call incoming from Altium 365.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ReadTypeIdentifiers  | TypeRequest                | *Part of Metadata service*<br/>This endpoint shall return IDs of available item types. Examples are 'capacitor', 'resistor' etc. <br/>This data will later be used during PLM Integration configuration in Altium 365 as a list of available options for Altium types mapping.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ReadTypes            | TypeIdRequest              | *Part of Metadata service*<br/>This endpoint shall return full information about the queried type, including its attributes list and relationship description.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| IsOperationSupported | OperationSupportedRequest  | This endpoint is called by Altium 365 to determine the capabilities of the current connector implementation. Depending on the result of this call, different actions can occur during sync/publish operations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| QueryItems           | QueryItemsRequest          | This endpoint is a simple query service that allows Altium 365 to ask for IDs of items that match the query criteria such as item type/attribute values etc. It does not return the entire items, only their IDs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ReadItems            | IdRequest                  | This endpoint shall return a list of items from the PLM service based on the requested item IDs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| CreateItems          | ItemCreateRequest          | This endpoint is called by Altium 365 whenever there is a need to create new item entries on the PLM side. It is usually called in chunks of *n* elements at a time. It is expected that this endpoint will respond with the list of newly created items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| UpdateItems          | ItemUpdateRequest          | This endpoint is called by Altium 365 whenever there is a need to update an already existing entry on the PLM service. It is usually called in chunks of *n* elements at a time. It is expected that this endpoint will respond with the list of newly created items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| DeleteItems          | IdRequest                  | This endpoint is called by Altium 365 whenever there is a need to remove an already existing entry from the PLM service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| UploadFile           | FileResource               | This endpoint allows Altium 365 to upload a file to the connector side. This file is usually required by the relationship of other PLM items. There is currently no limit set for the size of such a file. This endpoint does not require *Auth* information as it is not intended for the file to be immediately sent to the PLM service. This will most likely happen as soon as the *CreateRelationships* operation is called. This endpoint can be treated as a staging area for attachments needed by the *CreateRelationships* operation. |
| CreateRelationships  | CreateRelationshipsRequest | This endpoint is called by Altium 365 whenever there is a need to create a new relationship for an item. This command passes a relationship table, which is a list of pairs of objects (parent and child) connected with each other with a given relationship type (for example, an Attachment/AffectedItems relationship).                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ReadRelationships    | RelationshipRequest        | This endpoint allows Altium 365 to get relationships from PLM based on the provided relationshipID and type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| AdvanceState         | AdvanceStateRequest        | This endpoint is used to increase the item's lifecycle state to the next default state if the appropriate operation is marked as supported using the *IsOperationSupported* endpoint.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
