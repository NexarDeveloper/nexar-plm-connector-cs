# gRPC Interface description

**Nexar Generic PLM Connector** expects the service to implement gRPC endpoint defined
in **CustomPLM.proto** document. Following is list of those service methods with their brief description:

| Endpoint             | Parameters                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| TestAccess           | Auth                       | Used to verify that the credentials passed via the *Auth* parameter allow accessing the PLM service. <br/>Implementation of this method shall verify that the provided credentials allow user to read/introduce changes to the connected PLM Service. This check, by any means, does not act as Authorisation/Authentication of the call incoming from A365.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ReadTypeIdentifiers  | TypeRequest                | *Part of Metadata service*<br/>This endpoint shall return ids of available item types. Example of such could be 'Capacitor', 'Resistor' etc. <br/>This data will later be used during PLM Integration configuration in a365 as list of available options for Altium types mapping.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ReadTypes            | TypeIdRequest              | *Part of Metadata service*<br/>This endpoint shall return full information about queried type, including its attributes list and relationships description.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| IsOperationSupported | OperationSupportedRequest  | This endpoint is called by A365 to determine capabilities of current connector implementation. Depending on the result of this call, different actions can occur during sync/publish operations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| QueryItems           | QueryItemsRequest          | This endpoint is a simple query service that allows A365 to ask for id's of items that match query criteria such as item type/attribute values etc. It doesn't return full item, only their ids.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ReadItems            | IdRequest                  | This endpoint shall return list of items from the PLM service based on the requested item ids.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| CreateItems          | ItemCreateRequest          | This endpoint is called by A365 whenever there is a need to create new item entries on the PLM side. It is usually called in chunks of *n* elements at a time. It is expected that this endpoint will respond with the list of newly created items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| UpdateItems          | ItemUpdateRequest          | This endpoint is called by A365 whenever there is a need to update an already existing entry on the PLM service. It is usually called in chunks of *n* elements at a time. It is expected that this endpoint will respond with the list of newly created items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| DeleteItems          | IdRequest                  | This endpoint is called by A365 whenever there is a need to remove already existing entry from PLM service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| UploadFile           | FileResource               | This endpoint allows A365 to upload a file to the connector side. This file is usually required by the relationship of other PLM item. There is currently no limit set for the size of such file. This endpoint doesn't require Auth information as it is not intended for the file to be immediately sent to the PLM service. This will most likely happen as soon as *CreateRelationships* operation will be called. This endpoint can be treated as a staging area for attachments needed by *CreateRelationships* operation. |
| CreateRelationships  | CreateRelationshipsRequest | This endpoint is called by A365 whenever there is a need to create new relationship for an item. This command passes a relationship table which is a list of pairs of objects (parent and child) connected with each other with given relationship type (like Attachment/AffectedItems relationship).                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ReadRelationships    | RelationshipRequest        | This endpoint allows A365 to get relationships from PLM, based on provided relationshipID and type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| AdvanceState         | AdvanceStateRequest        | This endpoint is used to increase item's lifecycle state to the next default state - if appropriate operation is marked as supported via *IsOperationSupported* endpoint.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
