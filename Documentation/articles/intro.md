# Altium 365 Generic PLM Connector Documentation

The Generic Connector solution acts as a template for integrating your PLM solution with Altium 365.

This solution provides a base implementation of gRPC endpoints. 
It also provides a simple, file-based, implementation that acts as a PLM file server (**FilesystemPLMDriver** project) and  
can be used to test the configuration and observe the flow of typical sync operations.

Within this documentation, are instructions and example configuration files that will ease the process of code development and testing.
